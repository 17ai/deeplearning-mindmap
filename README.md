# Deep Learning Mindmap / Cheatsheet
A Mindmap summarising Deep Learning concepts, Architectures and the Tensorflow library.

## Overview
Deep Learning is part of a broader family of Machine Learning methods based on learning data representations, as opposed to task-specific algorithms. Learning can be supervised, partially supervised or unsupervised. This is an attempt to summarize this large field in one .PDF file.
